            <h2>FIFA ULTIMATE TEAM</h2>
        </section>
                <p>Five years ago today, Electronic Arts introduced the Ultimate Team mode in its main FIFA franchise. The mode offered a new, engrossing way to play the beloved soccer game, but it ended up being much more than that. FIFA Ultimate Team catapulted the series into new levels of global popularity, and heralded a new paradigm in game development just as the industry was shifting into a digital future.

                On the eve of Ultimate Team's fifth anniversary, we spoke with two individuals from developer EA Canada who have shepherded the mode along and helped turn it into the massive success it is today: Matt Prior, the producer who first brought Ultimate Team into FIFA with FIFA 09, and Adam Shaikh, current creative director for the mode.

               <h1 class="subtittle">Division rivals</h1>
                <p><strong>Division Rivals</strong> is the competitive part of FUT. Players face off online in matches that count up or down division points during each season, which lasts for seven days.

                This mode also gives access to FUT Champions, the esport part of FIFA, from which participants of official tournaments, with cash prizes, promoted by EA, come out.

                <p id="squad-battles">In <strong>Squad Battles</strong>, players face the Team of the Week (a team made up of special cards from players who have excelled in real championships) or teams of other players controlled by the game's Artificial Intelligence, selected at random. Wins yield good payouts, such as packs of cards and in-game coins.

                There are four options of teams to challenge, which are renewed after a certain period. In other words, if you win all four matches in a row, you'll have to wait a while before you can play Squad Battle again.

                <p id="draft-spac"><strong>FUT Draft</strong> is a mode that challenges both the skills on the field and the player's knowledge of building good squads. In it, you receive 5 random cards for each position, and you must create the best team you can.

                Then, you must play up to 4 games in a row against other players online or against the “machine” offline. The greater the number of wins, the better the reward at the end. Participation requires a “token” costing 15,000 coins or 300 FIFA Points (purchased with real money).

Upon achieving qualification for the event, participants will have the opportunity to play against the best players in their region and compete for rewards on FIFA. Furthermore, the championship is the main path for all those who wish to become a professional player and participate in the Global Series, which could open doors for the biggest FIFA 21 competitions, such as CONMEBOL eLibertadores and FIFA eWorld Cup.

            </section>
                <p>I started at fifa March 21st, and I still play today (09/12/21), this is my team I took all the players in packs, and some I did the dme. Patrick vieira was unbelievable I was very happy for taking him, still more because it was in a pack of 5 trading tokens. The game itself gives a good experience, but it's very unfair and several times I've opened really good packs, and bad cards came, and bad packs sometimes came good stuff. I lost a lot of unfair games, and I also won a lot of matches that were unfair to my opponent. This was my first full year in an fifa , and I'm very happy with my team and with everything I've learned in this game!

                 <h3>SALES RECORD</h3>
                 <p>The sports stoppage during the pandemic has negatively affected the finances of the sports industry. Against this scenario is EA Sports.

                In the first quarter of this year, the company had record sales with the FIFA game, reaching the mark of US$ 1.4 billion. In operating profit, EA was left with $471 million.
                
                "It was an unprecedented first quarter for our Electronic Arts business, with extraordinary growth in our live games and services and record financial performance," said EA Chief Executive Andrew Wilson in an interview with Inside World Football.
                
                During the quarantine, FIFA doubled the number of players and reached 7 million people globally. Over the past four months, the number of eSports streams across EA's game has been 85% higher than the full year of 2019.</p>

                     <h3>LOOT BOXES</h3>
                     <p>It's no secret that EA Sports has its goose that lays the golden eggs in FIFA Ultimate Team (FUT). The game mode most frequented by football franchise players earns millions in each edition of FIFA precisely because it has a known system of loot boxes, in which the more users spend, the better their teams get. But, according to a leaked document, the publisher's ideas are precisely to force the players to go to this mode.
                    According to the folks at CBC News, who are in possession of an internal presentation called "Run Up to FIFA 21", EA Sports intentionally directs players to the FUT to earn more money. In this file, it is quite obvious, according to the publication, that the company aims to bring more and more users to the game mode, even mentioning how the return of professional football after the pandemic can help with this.
                                </p>

                     <h3>HANDICAP</h3>
                     <p> The FIFA community differs on many issues within the game, but only one is unanimous: the supposed existence of the handicap. This feature, which has been in the game since many versions ago, helps and hinders players during specific points in a match, whether it's facilitating a goal at the last minute, or an unlikely turnaround after opening 2-0 on the scoreboard, for example.
